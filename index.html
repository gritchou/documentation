			<h3>About this method</h3>
			<p>Add new objects to an index.

				This method allows you to create records on your index by sending one or more objects. Each object contains a set of attributes and values, which represents a full
				record on an index.<br>

				If the index targeted by this operation doesn’t exist yet, it’s automatically created.<br>

				There is no limit to the number of objects that can be passed, but a size limit of 1 GB on the total request. For performance reasons, it’s recommended to push
				batches of ~10 MB of payload.<br>

				Batching records allows you to reduce the number of network calls required for multiple operations. But note that each indexed object counts as a single indexing
				operation.<br>

				When adding large numbers of objects, or large sizes, be aware of our rate limit. You’ll know you’ve reached the rate limit when you start receiving errors on your
				indexing operations. This can only be resolved if you wait before sending any further indexing operations.

			<h3>About this method</h3>
			<p>Replace an existing object with an updated set of attributes.<br>

				The save method is used to redefine the entire set of an object’s attributes (except of course its objectID). In other words, it fully replaces an existing
				object.<br>

				Saving objects has the same effect as the add objects method if you specify objectIDs for every record.</p>

			<p>This method differs from partial update objects in a significant way:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					With saveObjects, you define an object’s full set of attributes. Attributes not specified will no longer exist. For example, if an existing object contains the
					author attribute, but you don’t define it in your update call, it removes the author attribute from that object.
				</li>
				<li>
					In contrast, when using partialUpdateObjects, you can single out one or more attributes and either create or update their content. If you don’t define an
					existing
					attribute in your update call, it doesn’t impact it.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Using this method automatically chunks your records into batches of 1,000 objects, for performance reasons. If you’re indexing many records, and on a stable,
				high-speed Internet connection, you may want to override the default batch size with a higher value, letting you send more records per request and shortening your
				indexing time.
			</p>
			<p>Automatic batching is only available in the latest major versions of our PHP, Go, C#, Java, and Python clients.

				When updating large numbers of objects, or large sizes, be aware of our rate limit. You’ll know you’ve reached the rate limit when you start receiving errors on
				your indexing operations. This can only be resolved if you wait before sending any further indexing operations.</p>

			<header>Partial Update Objects</header>
			<h3>Update multiple objects</h3>
			<div class="code">
				index.partialUpdateObjects(array objects)
			</div>
			<div class="code">
				index.partialUpdateObjects(array objects, {
				// All the following parameters are optional
				createIfNotExists: bool,
				// + any requestOptions
				})</div>
			<h3>Update a single object</h3>
			<div class="code">index.partialUpdateObject(object object)</div>
			<div class="code">index.partialUpdateObject(object object, {
				// All the following parameters are optional
				createIfNotExists: bool,
				// + any requestOptions
				})</div>
			<h3>About this method</h3>
			<p>Update one or more attributes of an existing object.<br>

				This method lets you update only a part of an existing object, either by adding new attributes or updating existing ones.<br>

				You can partially update several objects in a single method call.<br>

				If the index targeted by this operation doesn’t exist yet, it’s automatically created.</p>

			<p>When updating many or large objects, be aware of our rate limit.</p>

			<p>Specifying existing attributes updates them in the object, while specifying new attributes adds them. You need to use the saveObjects method to completely redefine
				an existing object, or replace an object with a different one.</p>

			<p>You can’t individually update nested attributes. Specifying a nested attribute treats it as a replacement of its first-level ancestor. To change nested attributes,
				you need to use the saveObjects method. You can retrieve the object’s data by using the getObjects method.
			</p>
			<h3>Built-in operations</h3>
			<p>For convenience, we provide five different built-in operations to update an attribute without pushing its entire value. These operations can be helpful if you don’t
				have access to your initial data.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increment: increment a numeric attribute</li>
				<li>Decrement: decrement a numeric attribute</li>
				<li>Add: append a number or string element to an array attribute</li>
				<li>Remove: remove all matching number or string elements from an array attribute</li>
				<li>AddUnique: add a number or string element to an array attribute only if it’s not already present</li>
				<li>IncrementFrom: increment a numeric integer attribute only if the provided value matches the current value, and otherwise ignore the whole object update. For
					example, if you pass an IncrementFrom value of 2 for the version attribute, but the current value of the attribute is 1, the engine ignores the update. If the
					object doesn’t exist, the engine only creates it if you pass an IncrementFrom value of 0.</li>
				<li>IncrementSet: increment a numeric integer attribute only if the provided value is greater than the current value, and otherwise ignore the whole object update.
					For example, if you pass an IncrementSet value of 2 for the version attribute, and the current value of the attribute is 1, the engine updates the object. If
					the object doesn’t exist yet, the engine only creates it if you pass an IncrementSet value that’s greater than 0.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can specify an operation by providing an object with two following properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>_operation: the operation to apply on the attribute</li>
				<li>value: the right-hand side argument to the operation (e.g., increment or decrement step, value to add or remove)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Only the IncrementFrom and IncrementSet operations guarantee idempotent record updates. The other built-in operations aren’t idempotent and can cause unexpected
				side-effects, unless you use them in combination with the idempotent operations. For example, if you’re using the Increment or Decrement operations in a concurrent
				or multi-threaded environment, you may trigger it more than once and end up with incorrect data in your records.</p>

			<header>Delete Objects</header>
			<h3>Delete multiple objects</h3>
			<div class="code">
				<code>
					index.deleteObjects(array objectIDs)
				</code>
			</div>
			<div class="code">
				<code>
					index.deleteObjects(array objectIDs, {
						// + any requestOptions
					})
				</code>
			</div>
			<h3>Delete a single object</h3>
			<div class="code">
				<code>
					index.deleteObject(string objectID)
				</code>
			</div>

			<div class="code">
				<code>
					index.deleteObject(string objectID, {
						// + any requestOptions
						})
				</code>
			</div>
			<h3>About this method</h3>
			<p>Remove objects from an index using their objectID.<br>

				This method enables you to remove one or more objects from an index.</p>

			<p>There are two methods available to delete objects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					this one, which uses an objectID to identify objects
				</li>
				<li>
					and deleteBy, which uses filters to identify objects.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				As with other batch operations, each record included in the batch counts as one operation. If you pass an objectID that doesn’t exist, it still counts as an
				operation. This is because the engine doesn’t know if the record exists when attempting the operation.
			</p>
			<p>Removing all objects in an index doesn’t delete the index. You have to delete it manually with the deleteIndex method.</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Replace_All_Objects">
			<header>Replace All Objects</header>
			<div class="code">
				<code>
					index.replaceAllObjects(array objects)
				</code>
			</div>
			<div class="code">
				<code>
					index.replaceAllObjects(array objects, {
					// All the following parameters are optional
					safe: bool,
					// + any requestOptions
					})
				</code>
			</div>
			<h3>About this method</h3>
			<p>Clears all objects from your index and replaces them with a new set of objects.<br>

				Only your objects are replaced: all settings, synonyms, and query rules are untouched.<br>

				This method performs an atomic reindex: it replaces all records in an index without any downtime.<br>

				This method uses a temporary index. First, it copies your index’s settings, synonyms, and query rules to the temporary index. Then, it adds the objects you passed
				to the temporary index. Finally, it replaces your index with the temporary one.</p>
			<p>Before replacing all objects, make sure your source index exists. Our API creates a job even when an index doesn’t exist, but because it has no source index, the job
				won’t be able to end. If you perform a waitTask for this job, or set the safe parameter to true while the source index doesn’t exist, the wait will never resolve.
			</p>
			<p>Using this method can significantly increase your indexing operations count. It costs the number of new records + 2 operations (copySettings and moveIndex). For
				example, replacing all objects of an index with a new set of a million objects costs one million (and two) operations. Make sure you don’t exceed your record limit,
				and be careful of the impact on your operations count.</p>
			<p>Behind the scenes, using this method will generate a new, temporary index. If the API key used has restricted index access, the API will return an error when
				attempting this operation. To fix this, make sure your API key has access to yourIndex and yourIndex_tmp_*.</p>
